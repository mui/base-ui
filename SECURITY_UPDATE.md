# Security Fix: react-router Update

## Changes Made

Updated `react-router` from version 7.11.0 to 7.12.0 in:
- `packages/react/package.json`
- `test/package.json`

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

The update to 7.12.0 fixes the following XSS vulnerabilities:
1. React Router vulnerable to XSS via Open Redirects (CVE affecting versions 7.0.0-7.11.0)
2. React Router SSR XSS in ScrollRestoration (CVE affecting versions 7.0.0-7.11.x)

## Lock File Update Required

⚠️ **Important**: The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file needs to be regenerated by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This requires Node.js >= 22.18.0 as specified in the repository's `package.json` engines field.

The package.json files have been updated to use the patched version (7.12.0), but the lock file still references the old version (7.11.0) until `pnpm install` is run in the appropriate environment.

## Verification

After running `pnpm install`, verify the update with:

```bash
grep "react-router@7" pnpm-lock.yaml
```

This should show version 7.12.0 instead of 7.11.0.
