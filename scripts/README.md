# Scripts

## Release

A typical release goes like this:

### Prerequisites

1. You must be a member of the `@mui` org in npm to publish the release
2. Set up your npm authToken by logging into npm (`npm login`) . This will save a token to `~/.npmrc` as a line that looks
   like this:
   ```text
   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```
3. Make sure you have added the `material-ui-docs` remote to deploy the documentation:
   ```bash
   git remote add material-ui-docs https://github.com/mui/material-ui-docs.git
   ```
4. Generate a GitHub Token at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new and add it to your shell rc script (either `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Prepare

The following steps must be proposed as a pull request.

1. Generate the changelog with `pnpm release:changelog`
   The output must be prepended to the top level `CHANGELOG.md`
   `pnpm release:changelog --help` for more information. If your GitHub token is not in your env, pass it as `--githubToken <my-token>` to the above command.

2. Clean the generated changelog:
   1. Match the format of https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases.
   2. Change the packages names casing to be lowercase if applicable, e.g. change `Material` to `material`
3. Update the root `/package.json`'s version
4. Run `pnpm release:version`. Keep the package versions of stable public packages the same as the root `package.json` version.
5. Open PR with changes and wait for review and green CI
6. Merge PR once CI is green and it has been approved

### Release

1. Checkout the last version of the release branch
2. `pnpm install && pnpm release:build` (make sure you have the latest dependencies installed, and build the packages)
3. `pnpm release:publish` (release the versions on npm, you need your 2FA device)
4. `pnpm release:tag` (push the newly created tag)

### Documentation

`pnpm docs:deploy` to deploy the documentation (it lives at https://material-ui.netlify.app/) with the latest changes.
Force push if necessary.

### Announce

Follow the instructions in https://mui-org.notion.site/Releases-7490ef9581b4447ebdbf86b13164272d.

## Deploy documentation without a release

Sometimes it is necessary to deploy the selected commit(s) without
deploying all the changes that have been merged into the main branch
since the previous release (e.g. publishing a blog post or releasing
urgent docs updates).

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Add the `material-ui-docs` remote if you haven't done this already:

   ```bash
   git remote add material-ui-docs https://github.com/mui/material-ui-docs.git
   ```

2. Switch to the `latest` branch from `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git switch --detach material-ui-docs/latest
   ```

3. Cherry-pick the commit(s) that you want to include in the new deployment:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit>
   ```

   It will commit the changes if there are no conflicts.

   In case of conflicts you will need to resolve them and commit the changes manually.

4. Push the changes to the `material-ui-docs` remote:

   ```bash
   git push material-ui-docs HEAD:latest
   ```

5. Switch from detached `HEAD` back to your last checked out branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -
   ```
