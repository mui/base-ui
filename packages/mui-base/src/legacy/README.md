# Legacy Base UI components

The components and hooks in this directory expose an older version of the customization API.
They are kept in the repository to maintain history, but they are not published in the npm package.

We will update their API and move them back to the top-level directory.
See https://github.com/orgs/mui/projects/1/views/13 for the roadmap.
