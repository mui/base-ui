# Tabs

<p class="description">Tabs are UI elements for organizing and navigating between groups of related content.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentPageTabs.js"}}

## Introduction

Tabs are implemented using a collection of related components:

- `<Tabs />` - the top-level component that wraps the Tabs List and Tab Panel components so that tabs and their panels can communicate with one another.
- `<Tabs.Tab />` - the tab element itself. Clicking on a tab displays its corresponding panel.
- `<Tabs.List />` - the container that houses the tabs. Responsible for handling focus and keyboard navigation between tabs.
- `<Tabs.Panel />` - the card that hosts the content associated with a tab.
- `<Tabs.Indicator />` - an optional active tab indicator.

{{"demo": "UnstyledTabsIntroduction", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "bg": "gradient"}}

## Components

```jsx
import { Tabs } from '@base_ui/react/Tabs';
```

By default, Tab components and their corresponding panels are **zero-indexed** (that is the first tab has a `value` of `0`, then `1`, `2`, etc.).
Clicking on a given Tab opens the panel with the same `value`, which corresponds to the order in which each component is nested within its container.

Though not required, you can add the `value` prop to the Tab and Tab Panel to take control over how these components are associated with one another.

The following demo omits the `value` prop from the Tab components, and also defines `0` as the `defaultValue` for the Tabs component, which sets the first Tab and Panel as the defaults:

{{"demo": "UnstyledTabsBasic.js"}}

The next demo shows how to apply custom styles to a set of tabs:

{{"demo": "UnstyledTabsCustomized"}}

### Custom structure

Use the `render` prop to override the rendered element in any of the tab-related components:

```jsx
<Tabs.Tab render={(props) => <MyCustomTab {...props} />} />
```

If you provide a non-interactive element such as a `<span>`, the Tab components will automatically add the necessary accessibility attributes.

## Floating selection indicator

The TabIndicator component can be used to implement an selection indicator with animated position (transitioning from one selected tab to another).

To help with styling, the following CSS variables are set on the Indicator's rendered element:

- `--active-tab-top`: distance in pixels between the top of the currently selected tab and the top of TabPanel's bounding box.
- `--active-tab-bottom`: distance in pixels between the bottom of the currently selected tab and the bottom of TabPanel's bounding box.
- `--active-tab-left`: distance in pixels between the left-hand side of the currently selected tab and the left-hand side of TabPanel's bounding box.
- `--active-tab-right`: distance in pixels between the right-hand side of the currently selected tab and the right-hand side of TabPanel's bounding box.
- `--active-tab-width`: width of the selected tab's bounding box.
- `--active-tab-height`: height of the selected tab's bounding box.

Additionally, the Indicator has a `data-movement-direction` attribute representing the relation of the selected tab to the previously selected one.
Its value is one of the following:
- `previous` - the active tab is to the left of the previously active tab (or above, in case of vertical tabs)
- `next` - the active tab is to the right of the previously active tab (or below, in case of vertical tabs)
- `none` - there is no previously selected tab

Check out the following examples to see how an Indicator can be styled:

{{"demo": "Indicator.js"}}

### Server rendering

As the rendering of the Indicator depends on React effects, it cannot be done on the server.
This means that if you're using server-side rendering (SSR), the initially rendered content will not contain the Indicator.
It will appear after React hydrates the components.

If you want to minimize the time the Indicator is not visible, you can set the `renderBeforeHydration` prop to `true`.
This will make the component include an inline script that sets the CSS variables as soon as it's rendered by the browser.

```tsx
<Tabs.Indicator renderBeforeHydration />
```

It is disabled by default, as the script contributes to the size of the payload sent by the server.
 
## Customization

### Vertical

Tab components can be arranged vertically as well as horizontally.

When vertical, you must set `orientation="vertical"` on the `<Tabs />` component so the user can navigate with the up and down arrow keys (rather than the default left-to-right behavior for horizontal tabs).

### Third-party routing library

A common use case for tabs is to implement client-side navigation that doesn't require an HTTP round-trip to the server.

{{"demo": "UnstyledTabsRouting.js"}}

## Keyboard navigation

By default, when using keyboard navigation, the Tab components open via **automatic activation**â€”that is, the next panel is displayed automatically when it's focused.

Alternatively, you can set the panels not to be displayed automatically when their corresponding tabs are in focus. This behavior is known as **manual activation**.

To enable manual activation, set the `activateOnFocus` prop to `false` on the `<Tabs.List />` component:

```jsx
/* Tabs where selection does not follow focus */
<Tabs.List activateOnFocus={false} />
```

The following demo pair illustrates the difference between manual and automatic activation.
Move the focus to a tab in either demo and navigate with the arrow keys to observe the difference:

{{"demo": "KeyboardNavigation.js"}}

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/)

To make the Tab component suite accessible to assistive technology, label the `<Tabs.List />` element with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List aria-label="Seasons">
    <Tabs.Tab>Spring</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>Summer</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>Fall</Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>Winter</Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs.List>
</Tabs>
```
