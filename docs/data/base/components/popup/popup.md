# Popup

<p class="description">The Popup component is a utility that lets you display content in tooltips and popovers.</p>

{{"component": "@mui/docs/ComponentLinkHeader", "design": false}}

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentPageTabs.js"}}

## Introduction

The Popup is a utility component for creating various kinds of popups.
It relies on the third-party [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) library for positioning.

{{"demo": "UnstyledPopupIntroduction", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "bg": "gradient"}}

:::info
The Popup component, once stable, is intended to replace the [Popper](/base-ui/react-popper/) component, which will be phased out in a future release of Base UI.
:::

## Component

```jsx
import { Unstable_Popup as Popup } from '@base_ui/react/legacy/Unstable_Popup';
```

By default, the Popup is mounted to the DOM when its `open` prop is set to `true`, and removed from the DOM when `open` is `false`.

`anchor` is passed as the reference element to Floating UI's [`useFloating`](https://floating-ui.com/docs/react#positioning) hook.
The children are placed in a [Portal](/base-ui/react-portal/) prepended to the body of the document to avoid rendering problems.
You can disable this behavior with `disablePortal` prop.
See how it's done in the [Disable portal](#disable-portal) section below.

The following demo shows how to create and style a basic Popup.
Click **Toggle Popup** to see how it behaves:

{{"demo": "SimplePopup.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true}}

:::warning
By default, clicking outside the Popup doesn't hide it.
If you need this behavior, you can use the [Click-Away Listener](/base-ui/react-click-away-listener/) component.
:::

## Customization

### Placement

The Popup's default placement is `bottom`.
You can change it using the `placement` prop.
Try changing this value to `top` in the interactive demo below to see how it works:

{{"demo": "Placement.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false }}

### Transitions

You can animate the opening and closing of the Popup using CSS transitions, CSS animations, or third-party animation libraries.
It supports the API described on the [Base UI Transitions](/base-ui/react-transitions/) page.

### Disable portal

To render the Popup where it's defined in the source, without using [React portals](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal), pass in the `disablePortal` prop.
Note that it may cause visual clipping if a Popup is placed in a container without visible overflow.

You can use fixed positioning to prevent clipping when not using portals.
The Popup has the `strategy` prop which is responsible for determining how the position is calculated.
When set to `"fixed"`, the fixed CSS position will be used and the Popup won't be subject to overflow hiding.

### Floating UI middleware

If you need to modify the underlying [Floating UI middleware](https://floating-ui.com/docs/middleware), you can do so via the `middleware` prop.
By default, the Popup uses the [`offset`](https://floating-ui.com/docs/offset) (with the value provided in the `offset` prop), [`flip`](https://floating-ui.com/docs/flip) and [`shift`](https://floating-ui.com/docs/shift) functions.
If you provide your own middleware array, these defaults won't be applied.
