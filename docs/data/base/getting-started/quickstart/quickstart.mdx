## Installation

`@base_ui/react` is completely standalone – run one of the following commands to add Base UI to your React project:

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install @base_ui/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @base_ui/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @base_ui/react
```

</codeblock>

### Peer dependencies

{/* #react-peer-version */}

Please note that [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) are peer dependencies, meaning you should ensure they are installed before installing Base UI.

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
},
```
