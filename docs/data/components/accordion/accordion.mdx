# Accordion

<Description />

<ComponentLinkHeader design={false} />

## Introduction

<Demo demo="UnstyledAccordionIntroduction" defaultCodeOpen="false" bg="gradient" />

## Installation

Base UI components are all available as a single package.

<codeblock storageKey="package-manager">

```bash npm
npm install @base_ui/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @base_ui/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @base_ui/react
```

</codeblock>

Once you have the package installed, import the components.

```ts
import * as Accordion from '@base_ui/react/Accordion';
```

## Anatomy

Accordions are implemented using a collection of related components:

- `<Accordion.Root />` is a top-level component that wraps the other components.
- `<Accordion.Section />` is a component that wraps each section of content
- `<Accordion.Trigger />` is a button that toggles the open state of it's section
- `<Accordion.Heading />` is an element that wraps the `Trigger`
- `<Accordion.Panel />` is the element that contains content in a `Section`

```tsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Section>
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
  <Accordion.Section>
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
</Accordion.Root>
```

## Value

Each `Accordion.Section` is represented by a value, which by default is its zero-based index by DOM position.
The first section has an implicit `value` of `0`, the second section has a `value` of `1`, and so on.

The open state of the accordion is represented an array holding the `value`s of all open `Section`s.

You can optionally specify a custom `value` prop on `Section`:

```tsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Section value="one">
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
  <Accordion.Section value="two">
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Default value

When uncontrolled, use the `defaultValue` prop to set the initial state of the accordion:

```tsx
<Accordion.Root defaultValue={[0]}>
  <Accordion.Section>
    {' '}
    {/* `value={0}` by default */}
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
  <Accordion.Section>
    {' '}
    {/* `value={1}` by default */}
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
</Accordion.Root>;

{
  /* with custom `value`s */
}
<Accordion.Root defaultValue={['a']}>
  <Accordion.Section value="a">
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
  <Accordion.Section value="b">
    <Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Heading>
    <Accordion.Panel>Section two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Section>
</Accordion.Root>;
```

### Controlled

When controlled, pass the `value` and `onOpenChange` props to `Accordion.Root`:

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(['a']);

return (
  <Accordion.Root value={value} onOpenChange={setValue}>
    <Accordion.Section value="a">
      <Accordion.Heading>
        <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
      </Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Panel>Section one content</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Section>
    <Accordion.Section value="b">
      <Accordion.Heading>
        <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
      </Accordion.Heading>
      <Accordion.Panel>Section two content</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Section>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

## Customization

### Only one section open at a time

By default, all accordion sections can be opened at the same time. Use the `openMultiple` prop to only allow one open section at a time:

```tsx
<Accordion.Root openMultiple={false}>{/* subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
```

### At least one section remains open

Use controlled mode to always keep one section open:

```tsx
const [value, setValue] = React.useState([0]);

const handleOpenChange = (newValue) => {
  if (newValue.length > 0) {
    setValue(newValue);
  }
};

return (
  <Accordion.Root value={value} onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}>
    {/* subcomponents */}
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

## Horizontal

Use the `orientation` prop to configure a horizontal accordion. In a horizontal accordion, focus will move between `Accordion.Trigger`s with the <kbd class="key">Right Arrow</kbd> and <kbd class="key">Left Arrow</kbd> keys, instead of Down/Up.

```tsx
<Accordion.Root orientation="horizontal">{/* subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
```

## RTL

Use the `direction` prop to configure a RTL accordion:

```tsx
<Accordion.Root direction="rtl">{/* subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
```

When a horizontal accordion is set to `direction="rtl"`, keyboard actions are reversed accordingly - <kbd class="key">Left Arrow</kbd> moves focus to the next trigger and <kbd class="key">Right Arrow</kbd> moves focus to the previous trigger.
