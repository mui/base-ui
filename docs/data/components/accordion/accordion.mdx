# Accordion

<Description />

<ComponentLinkHeader design={false} />

## Introduction

<Demo demo="AccordionIntroduction" defaultCodeOpen="false" bg="gradient" />

## Installation

<InstallationInstructions componentName="Accordion" />

## Anatomy

Accordions are implemented using a collection of related components:

- `<Accordion.Root />` is a top-level component that wraps the other components.
- `<Accordion.Item />` is a component that wraps each section of content and it's associated `Trigger`
- `<Accordion.Trigger />` is a button that toggles the open state of its associated `Item`
- `<Accordion.Header />` is a heading (`h3` by default) that wraps the `Trigger`
- `<Accordion.Panel />` is the element that contains content in a `Item`

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

## Value

Each `Accordion.Item` is represented by a value, which by default is its zero-based index by DOM position.
The first `Item` has an implicit `value` of `0`, the second one `Item` a `value` of `1`, and so on.

The open state of the accordion is represented an array holding the `value`s of all open `Item`s.

You can optionally specify a custom `value` prop on `Item`:

```jsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item value="one">
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="two">
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

### Default value

When uncontrolled, use the `defaultValue` prop to set the initial state of the accordion:

```jsx
<Accordion.Root defaultValue={[0]}>
  <Accordion.Item {/* `value={0}` by default */}>
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item {/* `value={1}` by default */}>
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>;

// with custom `value`s
<Accordion.Root defaultValue={['a']}>
  <Accordion.Item value="a">
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel one content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item value="b">
    <Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
    </Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Panel>Panel two content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>;
```

### Controlled

When controlled, pass the `value` and `onValueChange` props to `Accordion.Root`:

```jsx
const [value, setValue] = React.useState(['a']);

return (
  <Accordion.Root value={value} onValueChange={setValue}>
    <Accordion.Item value="a">
      <Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle one</Accordion.Trigger>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Panel>Panel one content</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Item value="b">
      <Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle two</Accordion.Trigger>
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Panel>Panel two content</Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion.Item>
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

## Customization

### Only one `Item` open at a time

By default, all accordion items can be opened at the same time. Use the `openMultiple` prop to only allow one open item at a time:

```jsx
<Accordion.Root openMultiple={false}>{/* subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
```

### At least one `Item` remains open

Use controlled mode to always keep one `Item` open:

```jsx
const [value, setValue] = React.useState([0]);

const handleValueChange = (newValue) => {
  if (newValue.length > 0) {
    setValue(newValue);
  }
};

return (
  <Accordion.Root value={value} onValueChange={handleValueChange}>
    {/* subcomponents */}
  </Accordion.Root>
);
```

## Horizontal

Use the `orientation` prop to configure a horizontal accordion. In a horizontal accordion, focus will move between `Accordion.Trigger`s with the <kbd className="key">Right Arrow</kbd> and <kbd className="key">Left Arrow</kbd> keys, instead of Down/Up.

```jsx
<Accordion.Root orientation="horizontal">{/* subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
```

## RTL

To change direction for right-to-left languages, place the accordion in [`DirectionProvider`](/components/react-direction-provider) with the `direction="rtl"` prop, and set the `dir` attribute accordingly in your HTML to affect styling:

```jsx
<html dir="rtl">
  <body>
    <DirectionProvider direction="rtl">
      <Accordion.Root>{/* Subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
    </DirectionProvider>
  </body>
</html>
```

When RTL, keyboard actions for horizontal accordions are reversed - <kbd className="key">Left Arrow</kbd> moves focus to the next trigger and <kbd className="key">Right Arrow</kbd> moves focus to the previous trigger.

## Hidden state

`<Accordion.Panel />`s are unmounted from the DOM by default when they are closed. The `keepMounted` prop can be used to keep them mounted when closed, and instead rely on the `hidden` attribute to hide the content:

```jsx
<Accordion.Root keepMounted>{/* accordion items */}</Accordion.Root>
```

Alternatively `keepMounted` can be passed to `Accordion.Panel`s directly to enable this for only one `Item` instead of the whole accordion.

## Improving searchability of hidden content

<Callout type="warning">
  This is [not yet
  supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_global_attributes_hidden_until-found_value) in Safari and
  Firefox as of August 2024 and will fall back to the default `hidden` behavior.
</Callout>

Content hidden by `Accordion.Panel` components can be made accessible only to a browser's find-in-page functionality with the `hiddenUntilFound` prop to improve searchability:

```js
<Accordion.Root hiddenUntilFound>{/* subcomponents */}</Accordion.Root>
```

When `hiddenUntilFound` is used, `Accordion.Panel`s remain mounted even when closed, overriding the `keepMounted` prop on the root or the panel.

Alternatively `hiddenUntilFound` can be passed to `Accordion.Panel`s directly to enable this for only one `Item` instead of the whole accordion.

We recommend using [CSS animations](#css-animations) for animated accordions that use this feature. Currently there is browser bug that does not highlight the found text inside elements that have a [CSS transition](#css-transitions) applied.

This relies on the HTML `hidden="until-found"` attribute which only has [partial browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_global_attributes_hidden_until-found_value) as of August 2024, but automatically falls back to the default `hidden` state in unsupported browsers.

## Animations

Accordion uses [`Collapsible`](/components/react-collapsible) internally, and can be animated in a [similar way](/components/react-collapsible#animations).

Three states are available as data attributes to animate the `Accordion.Panel`:

- `[data-open]` - `open` state is `true`.
- `[data-starting-style]` - the `hidden` attribute was just removed from the DOM and the panel element participates in page layout. The `data-starting-style` attribute will be removed 1 animation frame later.
- `[data-ending-style]` - the panel element is in the process of being hidden from the DOM, but is still mounted.

The component can be animate when opening or closing using either:

- CSS animations
- CSS transitions
- JavaScript animations

### Styling

The `Accordion.Panel` element receives the following CSS variables about its dimensions, which can be used to style animations or transitions:

- `--accordion-panel-height`: Specifies the height of the `Panel`.
- `--accordion-panel-width`: Specifies the width of the `Panel`.

### CSS Animations

CSS animations can be used with two declarations:

```css
.AccordionPanel {
  overflow: hidden;
  animation: slideUp 300ms ease-in;
}

.AccordionPanel[data-open] {
  animation: slideDown 300ms ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideDown {
  from {
    height: 0;
  }
  to {
    height: var(--accordion-panel-height);
  }
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    height: var(--accordion-panel-height);
  }
  to {
    height: 0;
  }
}
```

### CSS Transitions

When using CSS transitions, styles for the `Panel` must be applied to three states:

- The exiting styles, placed on the base element class
- The open styles, placed on the base element class with `[data-state="open"]`
- The entering styles, placed on the base element class with `[data-starting-style]`

```css
.AccordionPanel {
  overflow: hidden;
  /* The final styles once closed/exited  */
  height: 0;
  transition: height 300ms ease-in;
}

/* The final styles once opened/entered */
.AccordionPanel[data-open] {
  height: var(--accordion-panel-height);
  transition: height 300ms ease-out;
}

/* The initial styles when opening/entering */
.AccordionPanel[data-starting-style] {
  height: 0;
}
```

### JavaScript Animations

Use the `keepMounted` prop lets an external library control the mounting, for example `framer-motion`:

```js
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState([0]);
  return (
    <Accordion.Root value={value} onValueChange={setValue} keepMounted>
      <Accordion.Item>
        <Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Trigger>Toggle</Accordion.Trigger>
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Panel
          render={
            <motion.div
              key="AccordionPanel"
              initial={false}
              animate={open ? 'open' : 'closed'}
              exit={!open ? 'open' : 'closed'}
              variants={{
                open: {
                  height: 'auto',
                  transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: 'ease-out' },
                },
                closed: {
                  height: 0,
                  transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: 'ease-in' },
                  transitionEnd: { display: 'revert-layer' },
                },
              }}
            />
          }
        >
          This is the content
        </Accordion.Panel>
      </Accordion.Item>
      {/* more accordion items */}
    </Accordion.Root>
  );
}
```
