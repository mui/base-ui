# About Base UI

An overview of Base UI, providing information on its history, team, and goals.

From the creators of Radix, Material UI, and Floating UI, Base UI is an unstyled React component library for building accessible user interfaces.
Our focus is on accessibility, performance, and developer experience.
Our goal is to provide a complete set of open-source UI components, with a delightful developer experience, in a sustainable way.

## Features

### Headless

Base UI components are unstyled, don't bundle CSS, and don't prescribe a styling solution.
You retain complete control over your application's CSS layer.
Base UI is compatible with Tailwind, CSS Modules, plain CSS, CSS-in-JS, or any other styling engine you prefer.

### Accessible

Poor accessibility can make your application difficult to navigate for all users, not just for users with disabilities.
Accessibility is our primary focus.
Base UI components adhere to [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) and are tested on a wide range of platforms, devices, browsers, screen readers, and other environments.

### Composable

Component APIs are fully open, so you have direct access to each node, you can easily add or remove parts, and you can wrap them however you prefer.
