          About Base UI
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          From the creators of Radix, Material UI, and Floating UI, Base UI is an
          unstyled React component library for building accessible user interfaces.
          Our focus is on accessibility, performance, and developer experience. Our
          goal is to provide a complete set of open-source UI components, with a
          delightful developer experience, in a sustainable way.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Base UI team is a small group of engineers, designers, and product
          people, working to solve incredibly complex and challenging UI problems on
          the web. In our work, we value craft, flexibility, and accessibility.

          The role
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We're looking for an experienced Design Engineer to join the team at
          Staff–Senior Staff level. You will help us improve the library across the
          board, including API design, performance, a11y, testing workflows, docs,
          support, and implementing components.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We're looking for someone who enjoys wearing many hats. Think less about
          spending many months implementing a single component, and more about
          leading developer experience, API design, a11y, docs, and maintaining
          overall product quality.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You will have a lot of autonomy to push for improvements. We are looking
          for someone who is passionate about UI design, with an exceptional eye for
          detail, and great taste in both visual design and API design.
