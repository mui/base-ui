Base UI components can be animated using CSS transitions, CSS animations, or JavaScript animation libraries. Each component provides a number of data attributes to target its states, as well as a few attributes specifically for animation.

## CSS Transition

Use the following Base UI attributes for creating transitions when a component becomes visible or hidden:

- `[data-starting-style]` corresponds to the initial style to transition from.
- `[data-ending-style]` corresponds the final style to transition to.

Transitions are recommended over CSS animations, because a transition can be smoothly cancelled midway. For example, if the user closes a popup before it finishes opening, with CSS transitions it will smoothly animate to its closed state without any abrupt changes.

```css title="popover.css"
.Popup {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
  background-color: canvas;
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
  transition:
    transform 150ms,
    opacity 150ms;

  &[data-starting-style],
  &[data-ending-style] {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}
```

## CSS Animation

Use the following Base UI attributes for creating CSS animations when a component becomes visible or hidden:

- `[data-open]` corresponds to the style applied when a component becomes visible.
- `[data-ending-style]` corresponds the style applied before a component becomes hidden.

```css title="popover.css"
@keyframes scaleIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

@keyframes scaleOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}

.Popup[data-open] {
  animation: scaleIn 250ms ease-out;
}

.Popup[data-closed] {
  animation: scaleOut 250ms ease-in;
}
```

## JavaScript animation

JavaScript animation libraries such as [Motion](https://motion.dev) require control of the mounting and unmounting lifecycle of components. Most Base UI components are unmounted when hidden. These components usually provide the `keepMounted` prop to allow JavaScript animation libraries to take control.
