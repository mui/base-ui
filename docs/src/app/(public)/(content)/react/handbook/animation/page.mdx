Base UI components can be animated using CSS transitions, CSS animations, or JavaScript animation libraries. Each component provides a number of data attributes to target its states, as well as a few attributes specifically for animation.

## CSS transitions

Use the following Base UI attributes for creating transitions when a component becomes visible or hidden:

- `[data-starting-style]` corresponds to the initial style to transition from.
- `[data-ending-style]` corresponds to the final style to transition to.

Transitions are recommended over CSS animations, because a transition can be smoothly cancelled midway.
For example, if the user closes a popup before it finishes opening, with CSS transitions it will smoothly animate to its closed state without any abrupt changes.

```css title="popover.css" {10-14}
.Popup {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 1rem 1.5rem;
  background-color: canvas;
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
  transition:
    transform 150ms,
    opacity 150ms;

  &[data-starting-style],
  &[data-ending-style] {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}
```

## CSS animations

Use the following Base UI attributes for creating CSS animations when a component becomes visible or hidden:

- `[data-open]` corresponds to the style applied when a component becomes visible.
- `[data-closed]` corresponds to the style applied before a component becomes hidden.

```css title="popover.css"
@keyframes scaleIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

@keyframes scaleOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}

.Popup[data-open] {
  animation: scaleIn 250ms ease-out;
}

.Popup[data-closed] {
  animation: scaleOut 250ms ease-in;
}
```

## JavaScript animations

JavaScript animation libraries such as [Motion](https://motion.dev) require control of the mounting and unmounting lifecycle of components in order for exit animations to play.

Base UI relies on [`element.getAnimations()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getAnimations) to detect if animations have finished on an element.
When using Motion, the `opacity` property lets this detection work easily, so always animating `opacity` to a new value for exit animations will work.
If it shouldn't be animated, you can use a value close to `1`, such as `opacity: 0.9999`.

### Elements removed from the DOM when closed

Most components like Popover are unmounted from the DOM when they are closed. To animate them:

- Make the component controlled with the `open` prop so `AnimatePresence` can see the state as a child
- Specify `keepMounted` on the `Portal` part
- Use the `render` prop to compose the `Popup` with `motion.div`

```jsx title="animated-popover.tsx" {12-18} "keepMounted"
function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Popover.Root open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <Popover.Trigger>Trigger</Popover.Trigger>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {open && (
          <Popover.Portal keepMounted>
            <Popover.Positioner>
              <Popover.Popup
                render={
                  <motion.div
                    initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
                    animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
                    exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
                  />
                }
              >
                Popup
              </Popover.Popup>
            </Popover.Positioner>
          </Popover.Portal>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </Popover.Root>
  );
}
```

### Elements kept in the DOM when closed

The `Select` component must be kept mounted in the DOM even when closed. In this case, a
different approach is needed to animate it with Motion.

- Make the component controlled with the `open` prop
- Use the `render` prop to compose the `Popup` with `motion.div`
- Animate the properties based on the `open` state, avoiding `AnimatePresence`

```jsx title="animated-select.tsx" {12-20}
function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Select.Root open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <Select.Trigger>
        <Select.Value>Value</Select.Value>
      </Select.Trigger>
      <Select.Portal>
        <Select.Positioner>
          <Select.Popup
            render={
              <motion.div
                initial={false}
                animate={{
                  opacity: open ? 1 : 0,
                  scale: open ? 1 : 0.8,
                }}
              />
            }
          >
            Popup
          </Select.Popup>
        </Select.Positioner>
      </Select.Portal>
    </Select.Root>
  );
}
```

### Manual unmounting

For full control, you can manually unmount the component when it's closed once animations have finished using an `actionsRef` passed to the `Root`:

```jsx title="manual-unmount.tsx" "actionsRef"
function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const actionsRef = React.useRef({ unmount: () => {} });

  return (
    <Popover.Root open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} actionsRef={actionsRef}>
      <Popover.Trigger>Trigger</Popover.Trigger>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {open && (
          <Popover.Portal keepMounted>
            <Popover.Positioner>
              <Popover.Popup
                render={
                  <motion.div
                    initial={{ scale: 0 }}
                    animate={{ scale: 1 }}
                    exit={{ scale: 0 }}
                    onAnimationComplete={() => {
                      if (!open) {
                        actionsRef.current.unmount();
                      }
                    }}
                  />
                }
              >
                Popup
              </Popover.Popup>
            </Popover.Positioner>
          </Popover.Portal>
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </Popover.Root>
  );
}
```
