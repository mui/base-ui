## Shared props

Base UI components are self-supporting and fully functional in isolation.

Each component has its own unique API, but most of the components accept the following shared props:

### render

The `render` prop lets you override the rendered element of the component.

For example, the Base UI Switch component renders a `<button>` by default.
The code snippet below shows how to use a custom component instead.

```jsx
<Switch.Root render={<MyFancyButton />} />
```

The custom component must forward a ref to its underlying DOM node and it must spread all the received props.

The `render` prop comes in two variants: the element one (as shown above) and the function one.
Using a function gives you complete control over spreading props and allows you to render different content based on the component's state.

```jsx
<Switch.Thumb
  render={(props, internalState) => (
    <span {...props}>{internalState.checked ? <CheckedIcon /> : <UncheckedIcon />}</span>
  )}
/>
```

### className

The `className` prop, in addition to accepting a string, can be defined as a function that takes a component state as an argument:

```jsx
<Switch.Thumb className={(state) => (state.checked ? 'checked' : 'unchecked')} />
```
