<Meta name="description" content="A high-quality, unstyled React textarea component." />

<Demo path="./demos/hero" />

## Anatomy

Import the component and use it as a single part:

```jsx title="Anatomy"
import { Textarea } from '@base-ui-components/react/textarea';

<Textarea />;
```

## API reference

<Reference component="Textarea" />

## Examples

### Infinite resize

Setting only a `minRows` will make the textarea automatically resize to fit its content.

<Demo path="./demos/infinite-resize" />

### Max rows

Setting both `minRows` and `maxRows` will make the textarea automatically resize between those limits.

<Demo path="./demos/max-rows" />

### Form integration

The textarea works seamlessly with the [Form](/react/components/form) component and supports libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for schema validation.

### Field sizing

[MDN: `field-sizing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/field-sizing) Â· [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=field-sizing)

The CSS `field-sizing` property lets form fields size themselves to their content. For example, a `<textarea>` can grow or shrink as you type without JavaScript.

Browser support is about **71 % globally**. Chrome 123+, Edge 123+, and Opera 109+ support it. Safari only recently added it in TP, and many others (Firefox, IE, Opera Mini, UC Browser, KaiOS) don't yet.

Because support is incomplete, the demo may not work in older browsers or Safari `<26`. If the textarea doesn't resize, try a **current Chrome or Edge** build.

> Once support passes ~90 %, we plan to switch the Textarea component to `field-sizing` by default, dropping the JS fallback.
