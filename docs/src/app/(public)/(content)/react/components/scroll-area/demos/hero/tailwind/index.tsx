            Vernacular architecture is building done outside any academic tradition,
            and without professional guidance. It is not a particular architectural
            movement or style, but rather a broad category, encompassing a wide range
            and variety of building types, with differing methods of construction,
            from around the world, both historical and extant and classical and
            modern. Vernacular architecture constitutes 95% of the world's built
            environment, as estimated in 1995 by Amos Rapoport, as measured against
            the small percentage of new buildings every year designed by architects
            and built by engineers.

            This type of architecture usually serves immediate, local needs, is
            constrained by the materials available in its particular region and
            reflects local traditions and cultural practices. The study of vernacular
            architecture does not examine formally schooled architects, but instead
            that of the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were
            rarely given any attribution for the work. More recently, vernacular
            architecture has been examined by designers and the building industry in
            an effort to be more energy conscious with contemporary design and
            constructionâ€”part of a broader interest in sustainable design.
