import { DemoSwitchHero } from './demos/hero';

<DemoSwitchHero />

## Usage guidelines

- **Form controls must have an accessible name**: The switch must have a meaningful label. Prefer using [`<Field>`](/react/components/field) to provide a visible text label and description, or use the `aria-label` attribute as an alternative. See the [forms guide](/react/handbook/forms) for more on building form controls.
- **Do not wrap in a `<label>`:** The switch renders both a `<button>` and an `<input>`, which makes wrapping it in a `<label>` invalid HTML. Instead, keep the `<label>` separate and associate it using `htmlFor`, or use a [`<Field>`](/react/components/field) with a `<Field.Label>` to provide the accessible name.

## Anatomy

Import the component and assemble its parts:

```jsx title="Anatomy"
import { Switch } from '@base-ui-components/react/switch';

<Switch.Root>
  <Switch.Thumb />
</Switch.Root>;
```
