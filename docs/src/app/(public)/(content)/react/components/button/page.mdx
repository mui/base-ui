<Reference component="Button" />

## Examples

### Rendering as another tag

The button can remain keyboard accessible while being rendered as another tag, such as a `<div>`, by specifying `nativeButton={false}`.

```jsx title="Custom tag button"
import { Button } from '@base-ui-components/react/button';

<Button render={<div />} nativeButton={false}>
  Button that can contain complex children
</Button>;
<Button render={<a href="https://base-ui.com" />} nativeButton={false}>
  Link that looks like a button
</Button>;
```

### Displaying a loading state

For buttons that enter a loading state after being clicked, combine `disabled` with `focusableWhenDisabled` to keep focus on the button and avoid disrupting the tab order.
