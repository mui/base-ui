## API reference

<Reference component="Button" />

## Examples

### Rendering as another tag

The button can remain keyboard accessible while being rendered as another tag, such as a `<div>`, by specifying `nativeButton={false}`.

```jsx title="div button"
import { Button } from '@base-ui-components/react/button';

<Button render={<div />} nativeButton={false}>
  Button
</Button>;
```

### Displaying a loading state

The `loading` prop can be used to indicate that the button is in a loading state, which will disable interactions without using the native `disabled` attribute to prevent the button from losing focus.
