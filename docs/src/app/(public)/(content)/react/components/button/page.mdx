```

## API reference

<Reference component="Button" />

## Examples

### Rendering as another tag

The button can remain keyboard accessible while being rendered as another tag, such as a `<div>`, by specifying `nativeButton={false}`.

```jsx title="div button"
import { Button } from '@base-ui-components/react/button';

<Button render={<div />} nativeButton={false}>
  Button
</Button>;
```

### Displaying a loading state

For loading states, the `disabled` prop can accept a `"focusable"` string to disable the button but keep it focusable. This prevents the button from losing focus after clicking it so the tab order isn't temporarily disrupted.
