## Install the library

Install Base UI using a package manager.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm i @base-ui-components/react
```

All components are included in a single package. Base UI is tree-shakeable, so your app bundle will contain only the components that you actually use.

## Set up portals

Base UI uses portals for components that render popups, such as Dialog and Popover.
To make portalled components always appear on top of the entire page, add the following style to your application layout root:

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
<body>
  <div className="root">
    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    {children}
  </div>
</body>
```

```css title="styles.css"
.root {
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

This style creates a separate stacking context for your application's `.root` element.
This way, popups will always appear above the page contents, and any `z-index` property in your styles won't interfere with them.

## Assemble a component

This demo shows you how to import a [Popover](/react/components/popover) component, assemble its parts, and apply styles.
There are examples for both Tailwind and CSS Modules below, but since Base UI is unstyled, you can use CSS-in-JS, plain CSS, or any other styling solution you prefer.
