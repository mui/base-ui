            From the creators of Radix, Material UI, and Floating UI, Base UI is an unstyled React
            component library for building accessible user interfaces. Our focus is on
            accessibility, performance, and developer experience. Our goal is to provide a complete
            set of open-source UI components, with a delightful developer experience, in a
            sustainable way.
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-2">
            The Base UI team is a small group of engineers, designers, and product people, working
            to solve incredibly complex and challenging UI problems on the web. In our work, we
            value craft, flexibility, and accessibility.
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-2">
            We're looking for an experienced Design Engineer to join the team at Staff–Senior Staff
            level. You will help us improve the library across the board, including API design,
            performance, a11y, testing workflows, docs, support, and implementing components.
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-2">
            We're looking for someone who enjoys wearing many hats. Think less about spending many
            months implementing a single component, and more about leading developer experience, API
            design, a11y, docs, and maintaining overall product quality.
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-2">
            You will have a lot of autonomy to push for improvements. We are looking for someone who
            is passionate about UI design, with an exceptional eye for detail, and great taste in
            both visual design and API design.
