# mergeProps

Merges multiple sets of React props. It follows the `Object.assign` pattern where the rightmost object's fields overwrite
the conflicting ones from others. This doesn't apply to event handlers, `className` and `style` props.

Event handlers are merged and called in right-to-left order (rightmost handler executes first, leftmost last).
For React synthetic events, the rightmost handler can prevent prior (left-positioned) handlers from executing
by calling `event.preventBaseUIHandler()`. For non-synthetic events (custom events with primitive/object values),
all handlers always execute without prevention capability.

The `className` prop is merged by concatenating classes in right-to-left order (rightmost class appears first in the string).
The `style` prop is merged with rightmost styles overwriting the prior ones.

Props can either be provided as objects or as functions that take the previous props as an argument.
The function will receive the merged props up to that point (going from left to right):
so in the case of `(obj1, obj2, fn, obj3)`, `fn` will receive the merged props of `obj1` and `obj2`.
The function is responsible for chaining event handlers if needed (i.e. we don't run the merge logic).

Event handlers returned by the functions are not automatically prevented when `preventBaseUIHandler` is called.
They must check `event.baseUIHandlerPrevented` themselves and bail out if it's true.
