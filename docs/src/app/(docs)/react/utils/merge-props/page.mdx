`mergeProps` helps you combine multiple prop objects (e.g. internal props + user props) into a single set of props you can spread onto an element.
It behaves like `Object.assign` (rightmost wins) with a few special cases so common React patterns work as expected.

## How merging works

- For most keys, the value from the rightmost object wins (like `Object.assign`).
- `className` values are concatenated right-to-left (rightmost first). For example, `mergeProps({ className: 'a' }, { className: 'b' }).className` is `'b a'`.
- `style` objects are merged, with keys from the rightmost style overwriting earlier ones.
- Event handlers are merged and executed right-to-left (rightmost first). So in `mergeProps({ onClick: a }, { onClick: b })`, `b` runs before `a`.
  - For React synthetic events, the rightmost handler can prevent earlier handlers from running by calling `event.preventBaseUIHandler()`.
  - For non-synthetic events (custom events with primitive/object values), all handlers always execute.

## Passing a function instead of an object

Each argument can be a props object or a function that receives the merged props up to that point (left to right) and returns a props object.
This is useful when you need to compute the next props from whatever has already been merged.

When you return event handlers from a function argument, `preventBaseUIHandler()` is not applied automatically to those handlers.
If you want that behavior, check `event.baseUIHandlerPrevented` yourself and bail out.

## Example

```tsx
const props = mergeProps(
  { id: 'internal', className: 'base', onClick: handleInternalClick },
  userProps,
);
```

## Notes

- `ref` is not merged.
