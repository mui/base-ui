## Canary Releases

Base UI publishes canary releases for each master commit. This is useful if you want to try out the latest features and fixes before they are released.

**Important:** canary releases may contain breaking changes and experimental features.

To install one of the canary versions run:

```bash
npm i https://pkg.pr.new/@base-ui/react@{master-commit}
```

Each PR also has its own release. To install one, run:

```bash
npm i https://pkg.pr.new/@base-ui/react@{pr-number}
```
