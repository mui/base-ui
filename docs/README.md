# Docs

This is the documentation of Base UI.

To start the docs site in development mode, from the project root, run:

```bash
pnpm start
```

If you do not have pnpm installed, select your OS and follow the instructions on the [pnpm website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Package managers other than pnpm (like npm or Yarn) are not supported and will not work.

## How can I add a new demo to the documentation?

[You can follow this guide](https://github.com/mui/base-ui/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)
on how to get started contributing to Base UI.
