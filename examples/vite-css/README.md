# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React + Base UI (styled with plain CSS) working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.19+ or 22.12+ is required)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or use npm/yarn if preferred)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Preview the production build

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Make sure to build the project for production with `pnpm build` first.

## Linting

To run ESLint:

```bash
pnpm lint
```
